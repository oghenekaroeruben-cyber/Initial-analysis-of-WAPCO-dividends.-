WAPCO Dividend ROI Analysis
​This project analyzes the ₦6 per share dividend announcement by Lafarge Africa (WAPCO) in February 2026.
​Key Analyst Tasks Performed:
​Data Cleaning: Used Python/Pandas to sanitize raw historical data, converting volume strings (e.g., "3.48M") into float values for calculation.
​Time-Series Formatting: Standardized date strings into Python datetime objects.
​Financial Modeling: Calculated net ROI across multiple price scenarios, accounting for a 1.35% brokerage fee and 10% Withholding Tax.
​Findings:
​My analysis shows that at an entry price of ₦190, the net dividend yield is approximately 2.8% over a 60-day holding period.
